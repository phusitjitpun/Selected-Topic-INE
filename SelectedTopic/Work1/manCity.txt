Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. The club adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894. Having won eight League titles, six FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA Community Shields and one European Cup Winners Cup, it is the fifth-most successful club in English football.

Manchester City joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. The club had success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. They won promotion back to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained in the Premier League since.

The club received considerable financial investment in both playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008,[4] winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, followed by another League title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. In addition to winning the third Premier League title in the Guardiola era, City reached their first European Cup final in 2021, where they lost to Chelsea.

Manchester City's revenue was the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 2018–19 season at €568.4 million. In 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.69 billion. The club is owned by the City Football Group Limited, a British-based holding company valued at £3.73 (US$4.8) billion in November 2019.
